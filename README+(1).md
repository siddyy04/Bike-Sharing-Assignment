## General Information
-Introduction This is a Programatic assignment, with an objective to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

-Background: A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

-Business Goal: You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

Dataset used: Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

## Conclusions
-Temperature is the one of the most important Feature which affects the Business positively,

-Apart from that, the other Environmental conditions like Rain, Humidity, WindSpeed & Cloudy climate affects the Business negatively.

-They need to come up with a plan to tackle Bad weather conditions, thus solving the User 's concerns.

-Customers use their bikes during Winter & Summer since due to high demand, But It seems that Customers less less during rainy Season.

-People rent a bike during Saturdays than the other usual days.

-The Demand of Bike rent is increased in 2019 than the previous yrear 2018, which gives us an idea that Bike sharing business is seeing progress.

-BOOM Bikes can expect their business to grow by 19%
